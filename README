PURPOSE

The exceptions thrown from Java reflection calls are all direct subclasses of
Exception, except for when they are direct subclasses RuntimeException. This
creates an ugly try catch block that is very difficult to test. This library
is a light wrapper around the Java reflection classes that catches any
reflection based exceptions and wraps them so that the try catch block for a
reflective invocation or a method or constructor can be implemented with a
single catch block.

MOTIVATION

Correctly reporting reflection exceptions is made difficult by the fact that you
must handle each exception, even when you take no special actions based the type
of reflection exception thrown.

This is not an attempt to bury the exceptions raised by reflection, the
exception raised is still a checked exception. It makes it much easier to test,
however, and to be confident that your application handles relfection exceptions
correctly.
